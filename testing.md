# Manual Application Testing

Below is reasonable test I could imagine to check every validation and all results came back as expected.

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>What is being tested</th>
    <th>How</th>
    <th>Expected Response</th>
    <th>Actual Response</th>
    <th>Outcome</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Start</td>
    <td>n/a</td>
    <td>Loads main menu</td>
    <td>Program runs and loads main menu</td>
    <td>PASS</td>
  </tr>
  
</table>
